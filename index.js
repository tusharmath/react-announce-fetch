/**
 * Takes in `request` parameters that will be used to call the {@link external:fetch} function.
 * The request params is essentially the arguments to the {@link external:fetch} function â€” `[url, options]`.
 * Internally the request observable is used as follows:
 * ```js
 * request.flatMap(params => fetch.apply(null, params))
 * ```
 * ##### Performance:
 * Though you can simply use the code above this module a couple of extra things to optimize interms of making HTTP requests.
 *
 * 1. API requests are only made once per notification on the request stream, irrespective of how many subscribers have subscribed to it.
 * Once a response is received it is shared by all its subscribers.
 *
 * 2. No API requests must be made until there is at least one subscriber on the response stream.
 * Once there is a subscriber only one request should be made with the latest value on the request stream.
 *
 * 3. In case a subscriber disposes and resubscribes later in time, it should get the most recent response.
 * 
 * @param {external:Observable} request - Request stream that emits params for the {@link external:fetch} function as an array.
 * @param {function} [fetch=window.fetch.bind(window)] - Optional custom fetch method
 * @return {external:Observable} Emits the Response Object that returned by {@link external:fetch}
